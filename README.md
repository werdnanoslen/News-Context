News-Context
============

Browser plugin to augment news articles with context

This is a user-defined dictionary approach to named-entity recognition (NER) for news articles.

By allowing the user or content curator to define dictionaries for NER, users can find more context in what they read more easily, and content curators can better engage their users with pertinent content.
